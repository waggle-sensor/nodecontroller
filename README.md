# Node Controller

The *node controller* is a single-board Linux computer providing encrypted TCP/IP messaging, data caching, node health monitoring, and cybersecurity tools including cryptokey management and signed software. While the above tasks are its main priority, through container-based isolation technologies, the node controller is also available to run user applications on the dedicated CPU-GPU resources.

We are actively developing the current generation node controller [here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/nodecontroller-arm64) and are maintaining the previous generation [here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/nodecontroller-arm32).
