# Node Controller

The *node controller* is a single-board Linux computer providing encrypted TCP/IP messaging, data caching, node health monitoring, and cybersecurity tools including cryptokey management and signed software. While the above tasks are its main priority, through container-based isolation technologies, the node controller is also available to run user applications on the dedicated CPU-GPU resources.
